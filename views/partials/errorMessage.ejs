<% if(locals.errorMessage != null) {%>
    <%= errorMessage  %>

<!-- 19:45 i followed exactly your steps but it keeps saying that errorMessage is undefined 

never mind i fixed it, instead of doing res.render(`authors`, { errorMessage : `something went wrong`})


declare the an object first containing them :  let locals = { errorMessage : `something went wrong` }


then  res.render(`authors`, locals)


then in errorMessage.ejs : <%= locals.errorMessage %> -->
<!-- I noticed I got the error when I mistakenly put !== instead of != in the IF statement
